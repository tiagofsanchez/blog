A couple of months back I wrote about the [importance of APIs](https://www.tiagofsanchez.com/ap-is-are-the-new-railroad), comparing then to importance of railroads as a fundamental underlying infrastructure to accelerate growth, value and promote humanity to collaborate at scale. My views haven't change. 

A week after finishing Udacity React nanodegree I have created a very simple app [(crushingwfh)](http://crushingwfh.com/) that is nothing more than a database of tools to help people that now have to work from home. Doing this wouldn't have been possible without the use of APIs. And by the way none of the tools in [crushingwfh](http://crushingwfh.com/) would exist without the power of APIs. The project is open source and you can fork the [repo](https://github.com/tiagofsanchez/wfh-tools) anytime you would like. 

It is interesting to note that my small little project wouldn't be live without the help of the people and community behind [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). Whenever I faced any technical question or problem it was always easy to reach out over [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), and if something simple a quick skim through their documentation would do the thing. This is the power of tools that are open source and have fantastic communities behind them. 

Please note that I am not trying to say that these are the best communities and open source projects out there. I am just making and argument around the importance of open source in the way we create value and build stuff. The speed of delivery and the way we perceived trust changes altogether. I don't personally know any of the people behind both React and Gatsby, yet they don't only allow me to use their technology but also are willing to answer my queries over a web chat. This is absolutely amazing.  

On the other hand, you also have thousands of companies that their sole purpose is to create and protect IP. They are very good at what they do, they have customers that depend on their products and normally their product is develop as part of a great internal effort. From a product management perspective this could be a little bit easier to manage given that only a couple key stakeholders would be involved in the process.   

Who is right and who is wrong? Well I don't know...time will tell, I guess. Today though I am biased and truly believe that collaboration wins, this is what makes us able to achieve great things and truly make a difference. Today I don't want to dwell on this too much, just wanted to understand how could I help out with the skills that I have? What open source project should I get involved on? 

I have learnt a lot from the open source community so now I think it is time to give back, specially considering the new situation we are currently living. I am pressing pause on all my personal projects and would love to get involved in any open source project that is related to the current pandemic. Let me know of any open source project that: 

- It is open sourced
- Is related to covid-19
- Helps people and communities affected
- Is using ReactJS
- Accepts a newbie 

I googled for projects, only to find the usual open sourced projects:

- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)
- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)  

They are great, but not for now. So if you know of any project that could be a match just let me know as I am keen to help and contribute. 

See you around and stay safe.
