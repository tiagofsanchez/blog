And here I am, a couple of weeks of starting my blog, now with a couple of posts. Not yet what I want or like, but a very nice work in progress, I would say. Something that I will refine, improve and learn from. After all, that was the goal, to learn more stuff about coding!

Let's have a look to what I have written when I started:

```text
Using the Gatsby blog theme to create my new blog.
In this blog I will write about new stuff that I been doing and learning, such as:
- ✍️ learning to code (front-end-development in React);
- 🏃‍ getting outside my comfort zone with running (for now);
- 💡 innovation and fintech related topics;
- ✈️ travelling with my family;

At the moment I am just creating the template for the blog with a couple of tweaks to the Gatsby theme.
Stuff that I need to do:
1. Add timeToRead (tags and categories) to main page of the blog;
2. Publish using Netifly;
3. Header / Navigation to get (a)all posts and (b)posts by category;
4. Subscription form;
5. ...

```

Well, at the moment I am trying to tackle activity number 3 - I wanted to create a navigation menu where the user would be able to select the different types of categories of posts, have them rendered in one page and select the post according to his need. For that I needed to learn a couple of things first, so I decided to work on a new gatsby site using `gatsby-starter-hello-world` to make things easier.

This was the end result:

![](https://github.com/tiagofsanchez/gatsbyBlogTags/blob/master/src/images/blogTags.gif?raw=true)

Let's check out how this was done.

# Working through the markdown files

I will assume that you are familiar with gatsby, so will go through this first step rather quickly. Here, there are two things that you have to bear in mind; (1) you need to enable gatsby to go through your files and read them so that you can have access to their data and (2) you need to enable gatsby to understand what he is looking for, and in this particular case that will be your Markdown files.

## Let's start with (1)

Here you will have to use the `gatsby-source-filesystem` plugin, install it using `npm install --save gatsby-source-filesystem` and add it in your `gatsby-config.js` file (we will do this after going through (2)).

## (2) Letting gatsby know what he should be looking for

For that you will need to use `gatsby-transformer-remark` plugin, and in the exact same way that you install your first plugin: `npm install --save gatsby-transformer-remark` and add it in your `gatsby-config.js`.

```jsx
//gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    "gatsby-transformer-remark",
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: "pages",
        path: `${__dirname}/src/pages`
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

Now, your gatsby is able to read through your Markdown files as well as "read" through them. This is absolutely crucial as you will need this to happen so that you can query for that information using graphQL. We will go through this in a little bit more detail latter in this post.

After doing all this, you will be able to go to your `index.js` file, that will be your home page, and render any blog posts (markdown files) that you have built in the `src/pages` folder.

> If you want to go through this in more detail, I would suggest the following gatsby [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-markdown-pages/).

# Building the slugs automatically

If you tried to `.map()` your posts in your `index.js` you will see that you can't click on them without encountering the 404 development page, hence we will need to create the slugs for the posts and make sure that they will render in a template that will be created for that purpose.

The question here would be how and where should one create the slugs? To do that you will be creating a new file `gatsby-node.js` on the main folder. Here I will drop the code that I have built to create the slugs and pages automatically and will explain what was done after the code.

```js
// need this to get access to path
const path = require("path");

// This will create a new page and "inject" props to a component
exports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions;

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const blogPostTemplate = path.resolve("src/templates/blogPost.js");

    resolve(
      graphql(
        `
          query {
            allMarkdownRemark {
              edges {
                node {
                  frontmatter {
                    path
                    title
                    tags
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        `
      ).then(result => {
        const posts = result.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges;
        posts.forEach(({ node, index }) => {
          const path = node.frontmatter.path;
          createPage({
            path,
            component: blogPostTemplate,
            context: {
              pathSlug: path
            }
          });
          resolve();
        });
      })
    );
  });
};
```

This is a lot of code, but let's go through this and let me try to explain

The `exports.createPages` will take 2 variables, "graphQL" to enable a query that is now possible because of what we did beforehand and the "actions" that will be deconstructed so that we use `createPage`.

After, I return a new `Promise` that will get a "resolve" and "reject". "resolve" will store the data from your (1) graphQL query and (2) you will let it know where the data should be rendered to.

> Here it is interesting to test the output of your query using your local graphQL compiler http://localhost:8000/___graphql, assuming that you are running `gatsby develop`

After getting the data that I want, I will loop through the posts and `createPage` for the `path` that I have got in my `frontmatter` and will push all that using the `blogPostTemplate` component that I will be creating after.

> To go through this in more detail gatsby provides a great [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#createPages) that could help you.

# A blog post template

This will be crucial for you to render your post in the way that you want it. Now that you have all the information that you need, you just need to create the template so that all the post would render in the same way in a programmatic way. The first thing to do here is to create a folder `src/templates/blogPost.js`. Actually in the step before, I was already considering that you will be doing this.

Here, and similar to what I did on the previous section, I will drop you the code and try to explain after. Here it goes:

```jsx
import React, { Fragment } from "react";
import Header from "../components/Header";
import { graphql } from "gatsby";

const Template = props => {
  const title = props.data.markdownRemark.frontmatter.title;
  const html = props.data.markdownRemark.html;

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Header />
      <div
        style={{
          fontFamily: "Verdana",
          margin: "auto",
          width: "80%"
        }}
      >
        <h2 style={{ textAlign: "center", marginBottom: "30px" }}>{title}</h2>
        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} />
      </div>
    </Fragment>
  );
};
export default Template;

// I will need the pathSlug so that I can query for the correct post
// This will query will inject data into props
export const query = graphql`
  query($pathSlug: String!) {
    markdownRemark(frontmatter: { path: { eq: $pathSlug } }) {
      html
      frontmatter {
        title
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

The `blogPost.js` will take the `pathSlug` in its props so that you can use graphQL to get the data that belongs in that particular post. And that is exactly what I am doing on the `export const query`. After having the information that I need and in context to that blog post, gatsby makes sure that `data` is injected in the props of this component so that we can render the blog in the DOM.

After getting the data passed into my component is just a matter of designing the component in the form that I want to. Here, I simply applied same CSS to render with a similar style when compared to the `index.js`.

# Building the tag's pages automatically

Now starts the interesting thing, building the tag's pages considering the inputs in the markdown files in a programmatic way. First of all you will need take into account that in your markdown files you will need to have those tags in your `frontmatter`.

```text
---
path: "/first-post"
date: "2019-09-01"
title: "My First post"
tags: ["this" , "whatsup" ]
excerpt: "This is a preview"
categories: "HOME"
---
```

In a similar way to the creation of the pages and `pathSlug` for the blog posts, here you will need to work on the `gatsby-node.js` files as well as to create a two new template component. For all the tags you will have `allTagIndex.js` and for the individual tags you can create `singleTagIndex.js`. Please bear in mind that the name really don't matter.

Let's start with the work done in `gatsby-node.js`, we will touch on the template pages on the next section.

```jsx
//This will create the pages that are required for the all tog and tags
const createTagPages = (createPage, posts) => {
  const allTagsIndexTemplate = path.resolve("src/templates/allTagIndex.js");
  const singleTagsIndexTemplate = path.resolve(
    "src/templates/singleTagIndex.js"
  );

  const postsByTag = {};

  //creating the list of tags so that we have 1 place for them all
  posts.forEach(({ node }) => {
    if (node.frontmatter.tags) {
      node.frontmatter.tags.forEach(tag => {
        if (!postsByTag[tag]) {
          postsByTag[tag] = [];
        }
        postsByTag[tag].push(node);
      });
    }
  });

  const tags = Object.keys(postsByTag);

  //creating the page with "all tag" posts
  createPage({
    path: `/tags`,
    component: allTagsIndexTemplate,
    context: {
      tags: tags.sort(),
      posts
    }
  });

  // creating the individual "tag" page with the correspondent posts
  tags.forEach(tagName => {
    const posts = postsByTag[tagName];

    createPage({
      path: `/tags/${tagName}`,
      component: singleTagsIndexTemplate,
      context: {
        posts,
        tagName
      }
    });
  });
};
```

All of this piece of code will go on top of the previous snipped of code from the previous section.

In the first part of my code, I am making sure that I get and object considering the tags that I receive from all the `posts` variable, and I do this because I don't want to have duplicated tags. Given that my end result is a to have an array so that I can (1) sort them and (2) create individual pages (slugs) for all of the tags, I will need to convert that object into an array. I am doing that using `Object.keys`.

Similarly to what happen with the `createPage` for the blog post template, I will be doing the same but now for a page that will contain all the tags and for individual pages that will accommodate individual tags.

For all tags I created `/tags` as the slug and will render that in `allTagsIndexTemplate`. On the other hand, for individual tags I am using `/tags/${tagName}` as the slug, where `tagName` will be any individual tag, and will render those in `singleTagsIndxTemplate`.

The one thing that is missing here is that you will need to call the function that we just created `createTagPages` into the `exports.createPages` after the `.then` so the we can receive the `posts` as one of the arguments.

# Rendering the post in the proper pages

Finally, the only thing that we are missing out are the template pages that we need to create. The templates will receive receive information via `pageContext` and render that information to the DOM accordingly. Bear in mind that `gatsby-node.js` will be injecting tags and posts arrays into the templates.

Here I will only demonstrate the `allTagIndex.js` component as the `singleTagIndex.js` will be very similar but instead of getting and array of tags will be only getting a single tag.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { graphql, Link } from "gatsby";
import Header from "../components/Header";
import TagsMenu from "../components/TagsMenu";

const AllTagsTemplate = ({ data, pageContext }) => {
  const { posts, tags } = pageContext;
  console.log(posts);
  console.log(tags);
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <div
        style={{
          fontFamily: "Verdana",
          textAlign: "center",
          margin: "auto",
          marginBottom: "40px",
          width: "80%"
        }}
      >
        <h2>Posts about all tags </h2> <TagsMenu tagName={tags} />
        {posts &&
          posts.map(post => {
            const { title, path } = post.node.frontmatter;
            return (
              <Link to={path} key={title}>
                <h4>{title}</h4>
              </Link>
            );
          })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AllTagsTemplate;
```

As you can see, this component will receive `pageContext` and we will deconstruct `posts` and `tags` so that we can render them in our jsx.

# Bonus: creating a tag menu

For me is was also interesting to test the concept of creating a menu for our tags, so that the user could click and could see the posts that had those tags. Here I managed to implement that with `TagsMenu.js` and `Tag.js` components. I am sure that this is not the best implementation, but it was a quick way for me to test this out and learn.

Bellow you can see the `TagsMenu.js` component implementation:

```jsx
import React, { Fragment } from "react";
import { Link } from "gatsby";

const TagsMenu = props => {
  const { tagName } = props;

  let tagOptions =
    tagName &&
    tagName.map((tagName, index) => {
      return (
        <Link style={{ textDecoration: "none" }} to={`/tags/${tagName}`}>
          <span
            style={{
              marginLeft: "10px",
              border: "solid 1px #eee",
              padding: "5px",
              backgroundColor: "pink",
              borderRadius: "5px",
              textDecoration: "none"
            }}
            key={index}
          >
            {tagName}
          </span>
        </Link>
      );
    });

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <div
        style={{
          width: "80%",
          margin: "auto",
          marginBottom: "50px",
          textAlign: "center",
          dispplay: "flex"
        }}
      >
        {tagOptions}
      </div>
    </Fragment>
  );
};

export default TagsMenu;
```

Going through this was very useful to me and I hope I can implement this in my blog. The only question that I have now is: will the implementation be similar given that I am using `gatsby-theme-blog`?

See you around!
