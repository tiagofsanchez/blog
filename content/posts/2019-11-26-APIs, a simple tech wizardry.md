Anyone that exchanged thoughts with me will know that I am a big fan of APIs as a mean to create new propositions, business models and quickly build and validate products and services that can be used by customers anywhere they are. 

For me technology is of the utmost importance in this day an age. I totally buy into Marc Andreessen's vision that "software is eating the world".

Now that we got that out of the way and I have confessed by bias, why should you believe in that? What does it mean for you, specially if you donâ€™t necessarily like or want to have anything to do with technology.Â 

To better explain why you should care, letâ€™s go back in time.

# Was Europe technology advanced?

History is a very interesting thing and it can definitely teach us a lot. Looking into the past as a way to understand what one should expect in the future can be misleading and we are, more often than not, wrong. However, indulge me on this thought process as I try to make sense of the European history and any lessons we can get from that.

On his book, [Sapiens, A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/), Yuval Noah Harari,Â does a fantastic job to explain the reason why Europe conquered the world despite all the odds. Harari kicks it off withe following statement: "Between 1500 and 1750, western Europe gained momentum and became master of the 'Outer World', meaning the two America continents and the oceans. Yet even then Europe was no match for the great powers of Asia. Europeans managed to conquer America and gain supremacy at sea mainly because the Asiatic powers showed little interest in them". 

You might be asking yourself, why does this matter? What are the implications, or even the analogies that we can derive from this? And, what is the connection with the fact that "software is eating the world"? Let's dig a little bit deeper so that we can make sense of it. 

First of all, and according to the writer, it is important to note that in 1755 Asia accounted for 80 per cent of the word economy. India and China alone represented two-thirds of the global economy and Europe, in comparison, was an economic dwarf. However, after 1850, the power shifted completely to Europe as a result of a new global order and culture. Harari defends that the European domination rested to a large extend on the military-industrial-scientific and technological wizardry. 

It was indeed a fact that at the time, Europe was going through their Scientific Revolution. However, during that period, the technological gap between Europe, India and China was almost nonexistent. Harari explains that: "the technology of the first industrial wave was relatively simple. Was it so hard for Chinese or Ottomans to engineer steam engines, manufacture machine guns and lay down railroads?"

> "In 1880, the West boasted more than 220.000 miles of railroads, whereas in the rest of the world there were but 22.000 miles of train lines (and most of these were laid by the British in India). The first railroad in China opened only in 1876. It was 15 miles long and built by Europeans - the Chinese government destroyed it the following year. In 1880 the Chinese Empire did not operate a single railroad." - Yuval Noah Harari 

In case you are guessing, the answer to the question above is: No! It was not difficult for the Chinese or India Empire to copy European technology advancements. The problem wasn't the lack of technology or knowledge, they lacked the values and myths that took centuries to form in the West and which could not be copied rapidly. 

# Europe's technology wizardry: the railroad

The railroad was not an advanced technology wizardry and anyone that wanted to copy it, could. Europe believed that by building railroads across different geographies canned food could reach their soldiers, medicines, doctors and supplies could quickly be deployed wherever there was a need for them. Goods and information could travel fast. As a result of this creed and, in a way, social structure and new global order, Europe was able to steam ahead. These logistical advances played a very big and important role in the European economic growth.

Today nobody questions the importance of the railroad. Trade, as we know it, couldn't exist without it and it would be extremely difficult for the Industrial Revolution to have happened. I am clearly simplifying things here, but the point that I am trying to make is that, it would be very hard for you to build an iPhone manufacturing plant in China if all the iPhone components weren't build there. How would you transport the chips to your plant? Could you get the screens to the assembly line in time? What would happen if you wanted to change your suppliers and they were outside of China? In short, the overall infrastructure grid that manufacturing, trade and commerce depend on are the "pipes" of the global economy and, to same extent, engines of innovation.


# The Digital Era

Fast forward to today, we live in the Digital Era, a point in time where technology increases the speed of knowledge within the economy and society. We move faster, are always online, connect and in constant interaction with information, being it for leisure or work. 

![mobile](../images/API-mobile.png)

> The average person spends 3 hours and 15 minutes on a smartphone â€“ that equates to almost 50 days per year

Same startups, well aware of this change, built multiple value propositions to serve a rapidly digital native population. As a result of all this new propositions user behavior and expectations changed drastically - we all want and need mobile digital experiences either for leisure or work.Â 

No need to dwell on this point to much. What is important to acknowledge here is that this big transformation is not only happening in a B2C but also in the B2B. And this is a game changer for governmental organizations, non-profits and the corporate world.

However, the startup revolution started out slowly but gained great momentum with the shift towards software as a service or SaaS models. This new model had great implications on how companies buy software given that businesses, over time, increasingly prefer software propositions that can help alleviate the hassles of integration, management, operations and procurement.

Today we keep hearing words like: Digital ecosystem , seamless customer journey, platforms, etc... This concepts are ubiquitous but what do they mean in practice? And why are they possible today? Simply put they are the result a fully integrated technology landscape via Application Programmatic Interfaces, or APIs.Â 

# APIs the new railroad connecting the world

You probably don't realize, but you are reading this blog post through an App that uses hundreds of API's to work. Your simple web browser uses [thousands of APIs](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/learning/web-api.html) to render information so that you can read it on your screen. 

The companies that you probably love - Uber, Airbnb, and many more - have a vast number of third-party APIs from third parties. Uber, for example, uses google maps for global maps, twilio for communications and Braintree for payments. What is interesting is that this new companies realize that they are better interconnected in a seamless way, then apart. Uber doesn't want to build a global mapping infrastructure, communication tools neither payment rails, however they can't live without them.In a similar way Apple doesn't want to own and build all the components of the iPhone, and they shouldn't. Apple is smart, selects and builds what are the core parts of their business and outsources what is not.

Apple business model is only possible due to the existing logistic infrastructure. Similarly, Uber value proposition wouldn't exist without APIs. API-first companies, and as a result, API-first products are far more extensible, are easier for customers to integrate with and have the ability to create and foster fantastic communities around different use cases. Companies such as [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) and [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) are great examples of startups that have built fantastic communities around their products.

# What does this mean for corporates? 

Time has showed us that the Chinese Empire, was on the wrong side of history regarding the railroad. As mentioned previously, the technology gap was not that wide, however the Chinese didn't believe that railroads were a big economic propeller. They have learned their lesson and are now betting big on the API economy. Companies like Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu are growing at an incredible pace as a result of their API ecosystems.

Despite the fact that same can perceive APIs as same sort of technology wizardry, they are indeed a new way to create and exchange value in a very similar way that railroads did in 1750. Corporates should embrace them as and opportunity to either consume or deliver products and services from or to third-parties.Â 

While there are a lot of challenges ahead, specially considering topics such as data protection and cyber threat, the opportunity of leveraging APIs far outweighs the risks. To same extent the railroads also faced different their cyber punks, Jesse James was one of the first bandits to hold up a moving train.

Looking into the past can definitely help us try to understand how the future will look like. However, I am biased and I guess that is not necessarily a bad thing.

Are you more concerned with Jesse James? Or do you want to leverage the new railroad?
