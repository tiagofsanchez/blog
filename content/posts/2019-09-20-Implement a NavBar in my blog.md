This little blog is starting to look a bit better, however there are still a couple of things that I would like to implement before "launching" this little project.

My progress is not necessarily lighting fast, but with a full time job and 2 kids I would say getting time to get stuff done is not a straightforward thing. Anyway, going back to our blog wishlist:

```text
1. âœ… the timeToRead detail information is not there;
2. any tags or blog posts categories (do they even exist?) don't exist;
3. would be great to have a header with the different categories for this blog;
4. styling topics:
   - bullet points with less space
   - break after the code snippet
   - size of the fonts on code snippet smaller
   - code snippet wider than the body text
   - blockquote with a pink lateral line
   - ...
5. comments "plug in"
6. a form for readers to subscribe;
7. ...
```

While [one of my latest posts](https://tiagofsanchez.netlify.com/2019-09-12-blogSeries-using-gatsby-tags/) was aiming at the **tags** and **categories** problem, in this post I am trying to solve for the issue of having a `NavBar` in the top of my blog.

The idea is simple, I want to have a static header so that I can have my name always visible and I also want to have to have the **night** and **day** toggle always available for the user. At the end of the end, I am also expecting to create and **about** page and that, together with the **categories** of the blog posts will be staying on the `NavBar` that I want to build.

## Adding navMenu as header of the blog

Let's get started then. First things first, I knew that I needed to change my `layout.js` component and, obviously create a new component, that in my case I called `navMenu.js`.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { css, Styled } from "theme-ui";
import Header from "./header";
import NavMenu from "./navMenu";

export default ({ children, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <Styled.root css={css({ zIndex: `100`, opacity: `1` })}>
      <NavMenu {...props} />
      <Header {...props} />
      <div>
        <div
          css={css({
            maxWidth: `container`,
            mx: `auto`,
            px: 3
          })}
        >
          {children}
        </div>
      </div>
    </Styled.root>
  );
};
```

Above you can see I have added `<NavMenu />` into my `layout.js` component, so let's have a look at that to better understand the changes made to that component. Before we check that though, just remember that I wanted to have the toggle in there, so to implement that quickly I just copied the `header.js` component that is sitting on my `/node_modules/gatsby-theme-blog/src/components`.

So far, easy. Now let's go to the more challenging piece.

## Building navMenu component

Bellow, and to simplify, I will only share the `return` of the component as this will be the biggest difference from the `header.js` component, so here it goes

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { css, useColorMode, Styled } from "theme-ui";

/*
We are missing a couple of const: 
- image
- Title
- checkedIcon
- uncheckedIcon
*/

export default ({ children, title, ...props }) => {
  const [colorMode, setColorMode] = useColorMode();
  const isDark = colorMode === `dark`;
  const toggleColorMode = e => {
    setColorMode(isDark ? `light` : `dark`);
  };

  /* 
    Hate this implementation, but this was the only way 
    I have found to inject the proper style here 
    NOTE: Now I know that I can change this with
    <Styled /> and passing css={css({background:`primary`})}
  */

  let backgroundColor = null;
  if (isDark) {
    backgroundColor = `#282c35`;
  } else {
    backgroundColor = "#eee";
  }

  return (
    <nav
      css={css({
        position: `fixed`,
        width: `100%`,
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        zIndex: "1000",
        height: `60px`,
        boxShadow: `1px 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)`,
        background: backgroundColor
      })}
    >
      <div
        css={css({
          maxWidth: `container`,
          mx: `auto`,
          marginTop: "17px",
          px: 2
        })}
      >
        <div
          css={css({
            display: `flex`,
            justifyContent: `space-between`,
            alignItems: `baseline`
          })}
        >
          <div css={css({ display: `flex` })}>
            <Title {...props}>{title}</Title>
          </div>
          {children}
          <Switch
            aria-label="Toggle dark mode"
            css={css({
              bg: `black`
            })}
            checkedIcon={checkedIcon}
            uncheckedIcon={uncheckedIcon}
            checked={isDark}
            onChange={toggleColorMode}
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </nav>
  );
};
```

A bit to big to digest, but really the only thing that you need to bear in mind is the introduction of the `<nav />` tag, to the `header.js` component, and the way I had to style it so that it stays in the right place, at the very top of our blog. In this case, as you can see, I am styling `<nav />` inline and using my `theme-ui`.

```css
//the way I first implemented the dynamic styling
let backgroundColor = null;
  if (isDark) {
    backgroundColor = `#282c35`
  } else {
    backgroundColor = '#eee'
  }

<nav
      css={css({
        position: `fixed`,
        width: `100%`,
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        zIndex: "1000",
        height: `60px`,
        boxShadow: `1px 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)`,
        background: backgroundColor
      })}
    >
    {...whatever}
</nav>

```

Here, what is interesting to note as well was that, when I implemented this approach the first time I was not aware of the `<Styled />` component and how that worked, so used a little bit of JS to make up for my lack of knowledge. After getting to understand how to use this new component, I refactored my `navMenu.js` component in the following way:

```css
<nav>
      <Styled
      css={css({
        position: `fixed`,
        width: `100%`,
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        zIndex: "1000",
        height: `60px`,
        boxShadow: `1px 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)`,
        backgroundColor: `background`
      })}>
      {...whatever}
      </Styled>
</nav>
```

Now I have one less constant and I am dynamically taking care of the style on a global basis on my `colors.js` files. That makes it easier to manage and a lot more scalable.

I was not particular happy with the implementation of the `navMenu.js` component together with the old avatar, so I had to change that a little bit.

## A better me on the avatar

To make that change, I need to change the `header.js` component as well as to create a `headerBio.js` to accommodate for a nicer avatar on my "main blog" page. Basically I didn't want the same styling used on the avatar at the end of each post and was looking for something a little bit bigger and with a central position on the page.

On the `header.js` component I will get rid of the `switch.js` component as it was previously there and will make sure that the newly created component `headerBio.js` will be properly aligned. I am not going to put the code here, but fell free to check my blog repo.

On the `headerBio.js` I only made sure that my avatar photo would be bigger.

That is it for this post! See you around.
