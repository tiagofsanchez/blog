I haven't write anything since I have started the course, however I have decided to do that now!

Just jotting notes with regards to stuff that I think it will be important: 
. Creating reusable components
. The different type of components
. State management and props
. Life cycle of a giving component, the things you should def know
. PropTypes, life savior
. React route
. Do you really need controlled components?

Great resources (I haven't read them all though :) )
