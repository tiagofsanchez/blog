          Ola, my name is Tiago and I am a dad, a strategist working in the
          innovation space and a developer apprentice. A couple of years
          back I moved to Singapore with my better half and our 2 kids have
          been born in the little red dot.

          I have started this website as a small experiment to teach myself
          how to code, to share that journey and to put "pen to paper" on
          stuff that I like to do and to think about.

          Briefly describing me wouldn't be complete without uploading a
          picture of the four of us ðŸ˜Ž! For some reason I couldn't find a
          nice picture with the four of us, go figure!
