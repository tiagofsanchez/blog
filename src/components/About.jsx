          Ola, my name is Tiago and I am a dad, a strategist working in the
          innovation space and a developer apprentice. A couple of years back I
          moved to Singapore with my better half and our 2 kids have been born
          in the little red dot.

          I have started this website as a small experiment to teach myself how
          to code, to share that journey and to put "pen to paper" on stuff that
          I like to do and to think about.

          Briefly describing me wouldn't be complete without uploading a picture
          of the four of us ðŸ˜Ž! For some reason I couldn't find a nice picture
          with the four of us, go figure!
